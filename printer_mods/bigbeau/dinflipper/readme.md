# What, and why?

This is just a simple mod that allows flipping the din rails in the electronics enclosure (and thus, the electronics enclosure itself), so that it can be more easily accessed from the inside of the chamber rather than from the bottom of the printer. This allows users to modify their electronics without having to turn the printer upside down, which can be cumbersome. 

I love this community and wanted to make something that others in it could use. Also, even though there's like 2 other existing din bracket mods, I wanted mine to be extremely simple and usable without having to purchase any additonal hardware. In other words... Provided you have a way to access your electronics from the inside of the printer (see below), you can download this bracket and install it right now without having to buy anything.

# How is this installed?

While you can mount it anywhere in any caridnal orientation, the ThickDin is designed to be mounted directly in front of the fans, as to not block their airflow. The ThinDin is designed to allow more rails to be installed, and works better in a front-to-back orientation, as they will block airflow when placed in front of the fans. ThinDin mounts can also be placed between the fans more easily than the ThickDin.

# So this only flips the rails... how do I access the electronics?

There are many ways to do this, but this mod is more focused on mounting the rails themselves. How you access the compartment is up to you.

On a Trident, you could cut your deck panel in half left-to-right and install handles. There also exists a mod for the front two z mounts that allows the deck to be removed easily, and that mod is available in the #voronuser_mods channel in the Voron Discord. It was created by @Logan#2225 as part of his own electronics flipping design.

This mod was designed for a Trident. While it MAY fit a v2.4, that printer already has a mod for a [car hood style electronics enclosure access](/printer_mods/xbst_/Bed_Hinge). The difference between the mounts in that mod and the dinflipper is that my mounts do not require any additional screws, using the same ones that the official mounts use. It's also guarenteed to work, whereas I'm not sure if mine will because I do not have a v2.4 to test it. If you test it, dm me and let me know if it works!

# Can you add...?

Maybe? Dm me on discord and if it doesn't take away from the goal of this mod (usability without additional required hardware) then I'll see what I can do. If you know some CAD, you could probably do it yourself. Show me what you do with it! :)
